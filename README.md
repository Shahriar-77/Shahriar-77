# 👋 Hi, I'm Shahriar Islam

**AI/ML Practitioner | Data Science | NLP & Deep Learning | Engineer Turned Problem Solver**

I’m a machine learning and data science enthusiast with a Master's in Mechatronics & Automatic Control (CGPA 4.0, UTM) and a BSc in Electrical & Electronic Engineering. I’ve transitioned from a strong research foundation in control systems to building practical, applied AI solutions — with a focus on clarity, reproducibility, and problem-first thinking.

## 🚀 What I’m Working On

- 🏡 **BA House Price Predictor** – A deployed Streamlit app that predicts property prices in Buenos Aires using geospatial features and Optuna-tuned regression.
- 🎧 **Whisper-Based Subtitle Translator (WIP)** – An offline app that transcribes and translates audio/video into multiple formats (.srt, .txt, .ass) using Whisper + NLLB.
- 🧠 **Computer Vision Projects (Inspired by WorldQuant & fast.ai)** – Designing and solving practical problems using CV techniques like CNNs, transfer learning, and GANs, drawing from my experience in WorldQuant’s AI Lab and ongoing learning through fast.ai and Hugging Face courses.

## 📚 Learning & Philosophy

I value **first-principles thinking**, clean code, and building solutions that are modular, interpretable, and meaningful. While I’m not a “guru,” I care deeply about learning the right way and solving real problems, not just completing tasks.

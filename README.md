**AI/ML Practitioner | Data Science | Computer Vision & NLP | Deep Learning | Applied Researcher**

I’m a machine learning and data science practitioner with a strong foundation in control systems and engineering. I design and implement applied AI solutions, specializing in **computer vision, temporal modeling, audio–video pipelines, NLP, and deep learning**. I focus on **reproducibility, clarity, and problem-first thinking**, bridging research concepts with practical, deployable systems.

## 🚀 What I’m Working On

- 🏡 **BA House Price Predictor** – A deployed Streamlit app that predicts property prices in Buenos Aires using geospatial features and Optuna-tuned regression.  
- 🎧 **Whisper-Based Subtitle Translator (WIP)** – An offline app that transcribes and translates audio/video into multiple formats (.srt, .txt, .ass) using Whisper + NLLB.  
- 🎥 **Video Understanding & Temporal Modeling** – Building and analyzing models for human action recognition and audio–video pipelines, focusing on temporal reasoning, representation learning, and practical dataset/compute constraints.

## 📚 Learning & Philosophy

I value **first-principles thinking**, clean code, and building solutions that are modular, interpretable, and meaningful. While I’m not a “guru,” I care deeply about learning the right way and solving real problems, not just completing tasks.
